Task description:
Attempt to classify the data; your criterion should be “accuracy”. Based on the methods covered in class, choose one or, at most, two classification methods that, 
in your opinion are most suitable for your data set. If one of these happens to be the method that is also suggested for this data set on the webpage / description or
the original, then do not use this method as your only approach. (I.e., you should select at least one method that has not already been suggested by the data
provider or in the original paper.) In your report, argue why you think your method is ideal, based on the selection principles discussed in class.

By submitting my assignment, I assure that I have worked on it independently, without outside help and only with the permitted aids. Furthermore, I affirm 
that I have not shared and will not share any results with anyone else other than the supervisors. I have taken note of the faculty’s rules and consequences 
for plagiarism and not complying with exam rules.
